SQL Server Change Tracking
--------------------------
Change Tracking allows to identify the rows which have changed. Change Tracking SQL Server Streaming Source leverage 
this to retrieve just the minimum information to keep a SQL server database in sync with a downstream sink. You can

[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-tracking-sql-server)

### Change Tracking and Change Data Capture
SQL Server also allow capturing the changed data through Change Data Capture. Change Data Capture provides historical 
information about the changes. This plugin uses Change Tracking over Change Data Capture because of the following 
reasons:

1. Historical Information: From a pipeline whose purose is to offload data from a database and/or to keep a database 
in sync with some external storage, historical information is not critical.
2. Schema Changes: Change Data Capture has very limited suport for schema changes in the table being tracked. 
New columns added to a tracked table are not automatically tracked. For more details please refer 
[Handling Changes to Source Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server#handling-changes-to-source-tables)
3. Supported Editions: Change Data Capture is only avaliable in DataCenter and Enterprise editions whereas 
Change Tracking is supported in Express, Workgroup, Web Standard, Enterprise and DataCenter.
